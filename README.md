# JPQuiz
A Japanese Language quiz game made in python with tkinter. A passion project I made for fun, and is an unfinished work in progress. How to customize is described in the game's help menu, or in the text files located in the help directory.

# Python Module Requirements
tkinter,
os,
random,
pygame,
sqlite3,
gc,
colorama,
threading,

# Setup
To set up the game, you must clone this repository, navigate into the JPQuiz directory, and run jpquizapp.py.
The game files will load, and a tkinter window named "JPQuiz" will open, starting the game.
A "save.db" file will be created upon startup that stores all of the game's save data. This file can be deleted to reset progress.
